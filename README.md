# Devember 2024 - Free Trader

This repository represents my entry into [Devember](https://devember.org/) 2024
and is a [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) version of
[Free Trader](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36659/free-trader), or at
least an attempt at one. I am not new to making small little games, but I *AM*
new to doing it entirely within Godot.

`Free Trader` is a free game created by Felbrigg Herriot in 2010 and is licensed
[CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/), as is
this particular project. More details about the source game can be found in a
[blog post](https://blackdogofdoom.blogspot.com/2010/09/free-trader.html) on
the [Black Dog Of Doom](https://blackdogofdoom.blogspot.com/) blog. The art
assets (when they are added) are the V2 assets by
[TGov](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/TGov). All of the original source material
is stored in [pnp-game-files](pnp-game-files/), but can also be gathered from
the links outlined above.

If you're viewing this in December of 2024, development work is ongoing live on
my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/odatnurd), which is serving as the daily
devlog requirement of Devember. What better way to follow what the day's work
was than to actually watch the day's work?

At the end of each day, the last commit made on that day (if any) is tagged,
allowing for easy viewing of the progression of the project over the given time
period. Note that due to the vagaries of streaming into the night colliding with
real life, sometimes the last commits are made and tagged after streams end or
(in rare cases) the next day at some point prior to the stream.
